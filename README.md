##**Career Counselling**
***
>Career Counselling is a process whereby professional guidance is offered to individuals which then helps them understand their skills, interests, personality, and career options to make informed decisions about their education, career path, and professional growth. I recieved career counselling where I was given information and assessments which helped me gain a deeper understanding about myself so I can make informed decisions about my future
